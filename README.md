# VPN-DN-synapse-normalization

This repository accompanys "Morphology and synapse topography optimize linear encoding of synapse numbers in Drosophila looming responsive descending neurons." 

It contains all code necessary for the modeling pipeline, skeletonizing DNs, modeling their synaptic activations, mapping receptive fields of VPNs, and investigating retintopy.
